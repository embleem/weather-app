## Accessing the Application

You can access the Weather Application in two ways:

1. **Deployed Website:** You can access the application by clicking the deployed website link. [https://embleem.github.io/weather-app/]

2. **Downloading the Code:** If you prefer to run the application locally or want to explore the code, you can clone or download the repository to your local machine. Follow the instructions in the Getting Started section below.

## Getting Started

To get started with our Weather Application, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.
3. Ensure you have an internet connection as the application relies on an API to fetch weather data.
4. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

Once you have the application open in your web browser, you'll see a simple interface with a search bar. To check the weather in a specific city, follow these steps:

1. Type the name of the city you want to check the weather for in the search bar.
2. Press Enter or click the "Search" button.
3. The application will retrieve the weather data for the specified city and display it on the screen.

You can repeat this process to check the weather in different cities as many times as you like.

## Technologies Used

Our Weather Application is built using the following technologies:

- **JavaScript (JS):** Used to handle the logic of fetching weather data from the API and updating the UI accordingly.
- **HTML:** Provides the structure and content of the application.
- **CSS:** Used for styling the application and making it visually appealing.
- **OpenWeatherMap API:** This application relies on the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data for different cities.

## API Usage

Our application utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. If you intend to use or modify this application, you'll need to sign up for an API key from OpenWeatherMap. Once you have your API key, you can replace the placeholder API key in the JavaScript code with your own.
